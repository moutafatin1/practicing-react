# Vite/ReactJs Template.

I made this template to learn how different things fit together and to stop procrastinating when starting new learning projects.

## Features
- Engine Locking to specify which version of NodeJs and package manager to use
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with a [basic reset for form styles](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) and a [Prettier plugin to sort classes](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) that automatically sorts classes.
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to check the quality of the project before commiting/pushing 
- Write unit and integration tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).
